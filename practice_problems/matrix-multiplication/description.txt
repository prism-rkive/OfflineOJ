Problem Title: Matrix Multiplication

Description:
Multiply two matrices A and B. Matrix A is of size n×m and matrix B is of size m×p. Output the resulting n×p matrix.

Input:
- First line contains two integers n and m.
- Next n lines each contain m integers representing matrix A.
- Next line contains two integers m and p.
- Next m lines each contain p integers representing matrix B.

Output:
- The resulting matrix of size n×p, each row in a new line with elements separated by spaces.

Example:
Input:
2 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
3 2
7 8
9 10
11 12

Output:
58 64
139 154

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n, m, p ≤ 100
- Elements of matrices are integers between -10^9 and 10^9
