Monocarp has got an array a consisting of n integers. Let's denote k as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that k is not an integer).

The mathematic mean of an array of n elements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i.e. sum divided by n).

Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from a so that the mathematic mean of the remaining (n−2) elements is still equal to k.

Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of positions [i,j] (i<j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n−2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2x10^5) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9), where ai is the i-th element of the array.

The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 2x10^5.

Output:
Print one integer — the number of pairs of positions [i,j] (i<j) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the mathematic mean of (n−2) remaining elements is equal to k (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of n elements of the original array a).
