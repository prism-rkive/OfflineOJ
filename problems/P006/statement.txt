Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour format.

24-hour format divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23, each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59.
12-hour format divides the day into two halves: the first half is AM, and the second half is PM
	-> In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12,01,02,03,…,11
	-> Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour from 00 to 23, and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59.

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output:
For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not remove leading zeroes.
