Given an array a of n elements, print any value that appears at least three times or print -1 if there is no such value.

Input:
The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2x10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2x10^5.

Ouput:
For each test case, print any value that appears at least three times or print -1 if there is no such value.
